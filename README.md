Initial commit.
PeppySpectrum is a software Spectrum Analyzer written in Python. It was originally developped as a screensaver for the [Peppy Player](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy.doc/wiki). With minor modifications it became a stand-alone application.
PeppySpectrum gets audio data from media players (e.g. mpd) via fifo/named pipe.
